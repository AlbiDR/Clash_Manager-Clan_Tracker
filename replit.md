# Clash Royale Manager - Replit Setup

## Project Overview

This is a modern Progressive Web App (PWA) for managing Clash Royale clans. The application features a Vue 3 + TypeScript frontend with a Material Design interface, powered by Vite for development and building.

**Key Features:**
- 🏆 Clan leaderboard tracking
- 🔭 Recruiter/headhunter for finding new members
- 📊 War log history and analytics
- 📱 Progressive Web App with offline support
- 🎨 Modern Material Design UI with Tailwind CSS

## Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework:** Vue 3 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite 7.x
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4.x
- **Routing:** Vue Router with hash-based navigation
- **PWA:** vite-plugin-pwa with Workbox

### Backend
- **Service:** Google Apps Script (GAS)
- **Purpose:** Acts as a data bridge between the frontend and Clash Royale API
- **Deployment:** Manual deployment required (see backend/GAS_Setup.md)
- **API:** RESTful endpoints exposed via GAS Web App

## Running the Application

The application is configured to run automatically on Replit. The Vite dev server starts on port 5000 and serves the frontend.

**Development Server:**
- Host: 0.0.0.0
- Port: 5000
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) enabled

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The application requires a Google Apps Script Web App URL to function. To configure:

1. Copy `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env`
2. Deploy the backend following instructions in `backend/GAS_Setup.md`
3. Add your GAS Web App URL to `frontend/.env`:
   ```
   VITE_GAS_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_ID/exec
   ```

### Backend Setup

The backend is a Google Apps Script that must be deployed separately. See `backend/GAS_Setup.md` for detailed instructions on:
- Creating a new GAS project
- Pasting the source code
- Configuring Clash Royale API credentials
- Deploying as a Web App

## Development

### Commands

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### Key Files

- `frontend/vite.config.ts` - Vite configuration (port, host, PWA settings)
- `frontend/src/api/gasClient.ts` - Backend API client
- `frontend/src/router/index.ts` - Route definitions
- `frontend/.env.example` - Environment variable template

## Deployment

The application is configured for deployment on Replit with static hosting. The build process:
1. Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
2. Bundles assets with Vite
3. Generates PWA manifest and service worker
4. Outputs to `frontend/dist/`

## Recent Changes

**December 8, 2024:**
- Initial setup for Replit environment
- Configured Vite to bind to 0.0.0.0:5000
- Updated base path from GitHub Pages (`/Clash_Manager-Clan_Tracker/`) to root (`/`)
- Added Replit-specific files to .gitignore
- Configured workflow for automatic dev server startup

## User Preferences

*No specific preferences documented yet.*

## Notes

- The application uses hash-based routing (`createWebHashHistory`) for GitHub Pages compatibility
- PWA features include offline support, caching, and installability
- Backend deployment is manual and required before the app is functional
- The app expects a GAS backend URL in the environment variables
