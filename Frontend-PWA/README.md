**Clash Manager Client** is the frontend PWA for the Clash Manager ecosystem. It is a "Headless" interface that consumes data from the Google Apps Script backend, designed to feel like a native app while running entirely in the browser.

It prioritizes **Offline-First** usability using a Stale-While-Revalidate (SWR) strategy:
1.  **Instant Load:** Data serves immediately from `localStorage`.
2.  **Background Sync:** Newer data is fetched silently from the GAS API.
3.  **Optimistic UI:** Actions (like dismissing a recruit) reflect instantly before network confirmation.

## ✅ Quality & CI/CD

This project is configured with GitHub Actions to ensure code quality and automate deployments.
*   **Automated Testing**: On every push to `main` or a `v*` tag, the full test suite is run. Failed tests will block deployment, preventing regressions.
*   **Automated Deployment**: Successful builds on the `main` branch are automatically deployed to GitHub Pages.
*   **Automated Releases**: Pushing a `v*` tag (e.g., `v6.2.0`) will automatically build the app, create a GitHub Release, and attach the production-ready `.zip` file.
